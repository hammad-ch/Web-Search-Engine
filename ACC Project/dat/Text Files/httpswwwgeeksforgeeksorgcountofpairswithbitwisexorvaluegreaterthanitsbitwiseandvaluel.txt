Find the count of all possible pairs whose bitwise XOR value is greater than bitwise AND value Examples: Input : arr[]={ 12, 4, 15} Output: 2 Explanation: 12 ^ 4 = 8, 12 & 4 = 4. so 12 ^ 4 > 12 & 4 4 ^ 15 = 11, 4 & 15 = 4. so 4 ^ 15 > 4 & 15 . So, above two are valid pairs { 12, 4 }, {4, 15} . Input: arr[] = { 1, 1, 3, 3 } Output: 4 Approach: Refer to the below idea for the approach to solve this problem: We know that, for an array of length N, there will be a total (N*(N-1))/2 pairs. Therefore check for every pair, and increase count by one if a pair satisfy the given condition in the question. Follow the below steps to solve this problem: Check for every pair whether there bit wise XOR value is greater than bit wise AND or not. If yes then increase the count Return the count. Below is the Implementation of the above approach: C++ // C++ program to Count number of pairs // whose bit wise XOR value is greater // than bit wise AND value #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function that return count of pairs // whose bitwise xor >= bitwise long long valid_pairs(int arr[], int N) { long long cnt = 0; // check for all possible pairs for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) { if ((arr[i] ^ arr[j]) >= (arr[i] & arr[j])) cnt++; } } return cnt; } // Driver Code int main() { int N = 3; int arr[] = { 12, 4, 15 }; cout << valid_pairs(arr, N); } Output 2 Time Complexity: O(N*N) Auxiliary Space: O(1) My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Previous Maximise occurrence of an element after K replacements within Array elements Next Count of pairs with bitwise XOR value greater than its bitwise AND value | Set 2 Recommended Articles Page : Count of pairs with bitwise XOR value greater than its bitwise AND value | Set 2 25, Mar 22 Maximize count of pairs whose Bitwise AND exceeds Bitwise XOR by replacing such pairs with their Bitwise AND 22, Feb 21 Maximize count of pairs whose bitwise XOR is even by replacing such pairs with their Bitwise XOR 22, Feb 21 Count pairs having bitwise XOR greater than K from a given array 25, Oct 20 Count pairs with Bitwise XOR greater than both the elements of the pair 06, Nov 20 Count pairs from an array whose Bitwise OR is greater than Bitwise AND 08, Feb 21 Find size of largest subset with bitwise AND greater than their bitwise XOR 25, Nov 21 Find the triplet from given Bitwise XOR and Bitwise AND values of all its pairs 10, Dec 20 Total pairs in an array such that the bitwise AND, bitwise OR and bitwise XOR of LSB is 1 07, May 19 Length of longest subarray in which elements greater than K are more than elements not greater than K 14, Aug 19 Count ways to generate pairs having Bitwise XOR and Bitwise AND equal to X and Y respectively 16, Sep 20 Count of Array elements greater than all elements on its left and next K elements on its right 05, Aug 20 Count of Array elements greater than all elements on its left and at least K elements on its right 29, Jul 20 C++ Program to Count of Array elements greater than all elements on its left and at least K elements on its right 21, Jan 22 Java Program to Count of Array elements greater than all elements on its left and at least K elements on its right 21, Jan 22 Smallest subarray of size greater than K with sum greater than a given value 27, Sep 20 Count of all possible values of X whose Bitwise XOR with N is greater than N 24, Feb 22 Count pairs with bitwise XOR exceeding bitwise AND from a given array 04, Oct 20 Count pairs with odd Bitwise XOR that can be removed and replaced by their Bitwise OR 25, Mar 21 Count pairs whose Bitwise AND exceeds Bitwise XOR from a given array 18, Mar 21 Calculate Bitwise OR of two integers from their given Bitwise AND and Bitwise XOR values 02, Dec 20 Count pairs having Bitwise XOR less than K from given array 25, Oct 20 Count numbers with difference between number and its digit sum greater than specific value 23, Jun 17 Find all possible pairs with given Bitwise OR and Bitwise XOR values 31, May 21 Article Contributed By : GeeksforGeeks Vote for difficulty Easy Normal Medium Hard Expert Article Tags : Bitwise-AND Bitwise-XOR Arrays Bit Magic Mathematical Practice Tags : Arrays Mathematical Bit Magic Report Issue Writing code in comment?
