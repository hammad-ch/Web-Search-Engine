Examples: Input: arr[] = {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0}, K = 2 Output: 5 Explanation: All possible jumps are: {0, 1, 3}, {0, 2, 3}, {0, 1, 5}, {0, 2, 5}, {0, 4, 5} So, the highest index that can be reached is index 5. Input: arr[] = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0}, K = 3 Output: 4 Approach: The problem can be solved based on the following observation: The highest possible value of K is same as the total number of shifts between consecutive 1s and consecutive 0s. As in a jump, the two values are different, so if K is even then the value at starting index and value at last index will be same and if K is odd ten they will be different. Now to find the highest index (when it is posssible to make K jumps), iterate from end of array and based on K being even or odd return the first index i such that arr[i] = arr[0] or arr[i] ? arr[0] (because it is already found that a total of K jumps can be made between them). Given below is an illustration for better understanding: Illustration: Consider arr[] = {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0}, K = 2. Highest possible value of K = 4: => Consecutive 0s in range [0, 0]. Total shifts = 0 => Consecutive 1s in range [1, 2]. Shift from consecutive 0s to 1s. Total shifts = 1. => Consecutive 0s in range [3, 3]. Shift from consecutive 1s to 0s. Total shifts = 1+1 = 2. => Consecutive 1s in range [4, 4]. Shift from consecutive 0s to 1s. Total shifts = 2+1 = 3. => Consecutive 0s in range [5, 5]. Shift from consecutive 1s to 0s. Total shifts = 3+1 = 4. Iterate from i = 5 to 0: =>For i = 5: arr[5] = arr[0] = 0. K = 2 i.e. even. Stop iterating Highest index that can be reached is 5. One such path is (0->1->5). Follow the steps mentioned below to solve the problem: Traverse the array from i = 0 to N-1: Find total shifts from consecutive 0s to consecutive 1s and vice versa (say count). If K > count, return -1 as K jumps is not possible. Otherwise, traverse from i = N-1 to 0: If K is even, stop iteration when arr[i] = arr[0]. If K is odd, stop iteration when arr[i] ? arr[0]. Return the highest index achieved from the above step. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++ // C++ program for the above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to find the index to which // the longest jump can be made int maxJump(int arr[], int N, int k) { int i; // To store possible cases count int count = 0; for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) { if (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) { count++; } } if (count >= k) { // Traversing the array A[] // from the end // to find longest index for (i = N - 1; i >= 0; i--) { // Firstly checking // if k is even and // if first and last element // match if (k % 2 == 0 && arr[i] == arr[0]) { // Return the required index return i; } // Or, if k is odd // and first and last // element doesn't match if (k % 2 != 0 && arr[i] != arr[0]) { // Return the required index return i; } } } return -1; } // Driver Code int main() { int arr[] = { 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0 }; int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); int k = 2; // Function call cout << maxJump(arr, N, k); return 0; } Output 5 Time complexity: O(N) Auxiliary Space: O(N) My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Previous Count of Array elements in given range with remainder X when divided by K for Q queries Next Count of numbers up to N having only 4 factors or divisors Recommended Articles Page : Farthest position that can be reached in a binary string in K jumps by jumping on alternate digits 03, Nov 21 Maximum jumps to reach end of Array with condition that index i can make arr[i] jumps 10, Jul 21 Check if end of a sorted Array can be reached by repeated jumps of one more, one less or same number of indices as previous jump 24, Nov 20 Farthest index that can be reached from the Kth index of given array by given operations 02, Dec 20 Check if a given value can be reached from another value in a Circular Queue by K-length jumps 06, Nov 20 Check if end of given Binary string can be reached by choosing jump value in between given range 15, Oct 21 Maximize sum possible from an array by jumps of length i + K * arr[i] from any ith index 17, Feb 21 Check if the end of the Array can be reached from a given position 16, Jun 20 Minimum jumps required to reach all array elements using largest element 07, Oct 21 Length of longest subarray for each index in Array where element at that index is largest 28, Jun 21 Find position after K jumps from start of given Array where each jump is from i to arr[i] 19, Jan 22 Minimum number of flips required such that the last cell of matrix can be reached from any other cell 18, Nov 20 Sort a String in decreasing order of values associated after removal of values smaller than X 11, Aug 20 Minimum jumps required to group all 1s together in a given Binary string 18, Jun 20 Maximum index a pointer can reach in N steps by avoiding a given index B - Set 3 (Binary Search) 29, Sep 21 Program to find the maximum difference between the index of any two different numbers 09, Apr 19 Maximise difference between largest and smallest in Array by shifting X value in pairs after at most K operations 27, Jan 22 Find i'th Index character in a binary string obtained after n iterations 19, Feb 18 Print the Array formed by reversing the given Array after each index 24, Nov 21 Minimum length of jumps to avoid given array of obstacles 18, Aug 18 Maximum score possible from an array with jumps of at most length K 05, Feb 21 Paths requiring minimum number of jumps to reach end of array 22, Sep 20 Count minimum factor jumps required to reach the end of an Array 05, May 20 Count of jumps to reach the end of Array by jumping from arr[i] to arr[arr[i]] 11, Oct 21 Article Contributed By : singhh3010 @singhh3010 Vote for difficulty Easy Normal Medium Hard Expert Article Tags : binary-string Geeks-Premier-League-2022 Arrays Geeks Premier League Greedy Practice Tags : Arrays Greedy Report Issue Writing code in comment?
