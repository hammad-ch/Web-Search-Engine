Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories: Sequential Search: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search. Interval Search: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: Binary Search. Linear Search to find the element ?20? in a given list of numbers Binary Search to find the element ?23? in a given list of numbers Topic : Searching Algorithms Comparisons Library Implementations of Searching Algorithms Coding Problems Quick Links Searching Algorithms : Linear Search Binary Search Jump Search Interpolation Search Exponential Search Sublist Search (Search a linked list in another list) Fibonacci Search The Ubiquitous Binary Search Recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array Recursive function to do substring search Unbounded Binary Search Example (Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time) Comparisons : Linear Search vs Binary Search Interpolation search vs Binary search Why is Binary Search preferred over Ternary Search? Library Implementations of Searching Algorithms : Binary Search functions in C++ STL (binary_search, lower_bound and upper_bound) Arrays.binarySearch() in Java with examples | Set 1 Arrays.binarySearch() in Java with examples | Set 2 (Search in subarray) Collections.binarySearch() in Java with Examples Coding Problems : Find the Missing Number Search an element in a sorted and rotated array Median of two sorted arrays Two elements whose sum is closest to zero Find the smallest and second smallest element in an array Maximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisons k largest(or smallest) elements in an array | added Min Heap method Ceiling in a sorted array Count number of occurrences (or frequency) in a sorted array Find the repeating and the missing | Added 3 new methods Find a Fixed Point in a given array Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing Find a pair with the given difference Find the k most frequent words from a file Median of two sorted arrays of different sizes Find a peak element Given an array of of size n and a number k, find all elements that appear more than n/k times Find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array Kth smallest element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted 2D array | Set 1 Find k closest elements to a given value Search in an almost sorted array A Problem in Many Binary Search Implementations Find the first repeating element in an array of integers Find common elements in three sorted arrays Count 1?s in a sorted binary array Given a sorted array and a number x, find the pair in array whose sum is closest to x Find the closest pair from two sorted arrays K?th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array | Set 1 K?th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array | Set 2 (Expected Linear Time) K?th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array | Set 3 (Worst Case Linear Time) Find position of an element in a sorted array of infinite numbers Given a sorted and rotated array, find if there is a pair with a given sum Find the largest pair sum in an unsorted array Find the nearest smaller numbers on left side in an array K?th largest element in a stream Find a pair with maximum product in array of Integers Find the element that appears once in a sorted array Find the odd appearing element in O(Log n) time Find the largest three elements in an array Search an element in an array where difference between adjacent elements is 1 Find three closest elements from given three sorted arrays Find the element before which all the elements are smaller than it, and after which all are greater Binary Search for Rational Numbers without using floating point arithmetic Floor in a Sorted Array Third largest element in an array of distinct elements Second minimum element using minimum comparisons Queries for greater than and not less than Efficient search in an array where difference between adjacent is 1 Print all possible sums of consecutive numbers with sum N Minimum time required to produce m items Make all array elements equal with minimum cost Check if there exist two elements in an array whose sum is equal to the sum of rest of the array Check if reversing a sub array make the array sorted Find all triplets with zero sum Search, insert and delete in an unsorted array Search, insert and delete in a sorted array Move all occurrences of an element to end in a linked list Search in an array of strings where non-empty strings are sorted Smallest Difference Triplet from Three arrays Best First Search (Informed Search) Quick Links : ?Practice Problems? on Searching ?Quizzes? on Searching If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
