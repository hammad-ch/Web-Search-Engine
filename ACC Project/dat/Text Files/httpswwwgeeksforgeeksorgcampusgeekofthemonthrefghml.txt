Thank you so much to complete team of GeeksforGeeks! Campus Geek of the month ? November 2018 Name: Ipsita Chakraborty Testimonial: I would like to take this opportunity to thank the GeeksforGeeks team for acknowledging me and my efforts. It has been a wonderful experience so long in the Campus Ambassador Program. GeeksforGeeks has always been a saviour throughout, be it last moment studies for exams, learning competetive coding or any new language or some algorithm. Being able to work with GeeksforGeeks is the utmost pleasure for any Computer Science student and I am glad to serve the GeeksforGeeks team as a Campus Ambassador. Being a part of this program, I got to communicate with so many students in my college having keen interest in coding. They were made aware of the different opportunities that GeeksforGeeks is providing like Sudo Placement, Fork Java, Fork CPP, etc. There have also been rewards for the top performers to keep them motivated and for the campus ambassadors as well to keep up the good work. Apart from that we have got assistance from the GeeksforGeeks team in conducting coding contests in the college. All in all, the entire team is doing great work involving students from colleges across the country and reaching out to each and every individual, imparting valuable knowledge. To all the students out there, keep learning, keep growing. Happy Coding ! ? My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Writing code in comment?
