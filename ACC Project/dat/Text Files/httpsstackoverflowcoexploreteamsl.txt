How do I get employees to adopt Stack Overflow for Teams? We have a full plan to help you roll this out to your team. It starts with you identifying and coordinating with a group of early users - we like to call these the ?founding members? of your team. They?re going to help you populate content, set community guidelines and encourage usage both short and long-term. How long does full adoption take? You can start to see the benefits within 60-90 days. You?ll be working with your founding members to add content, educating your internal teams and stakeholders about the benefits they?ll see, and start bringing people onto the platform. It doesn?t take long for people to see the benefit for themselves - especially if they are someone who gets a lot of the same questions over and over again. They can answer that question once, then point everyone to the Teams link in the future.
