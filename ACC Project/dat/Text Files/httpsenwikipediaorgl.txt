It provides educators with information on how to teach elementary school children to be tolerant of gay and lesbian people. The film was noted as the "first of its kind" and was generally well received, although there was some backlash from conservatives. It was released in several film festivals and had screenings in the 2000s. It's Elementary did not receive much support from PBS due to backlash from the American Family Association. Prior to airing the film, television stations received calls, letters, and e-mails from people who did not want PBS program directors to broadcast it. The film was awarded the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary, Best Documentary at the Reeling Film Festival, and the Silver Spire at the San Francisco International Film Festival, among other awards. The film had two sequels: That's A Family! and It's Still Elementary. (Full article...)
