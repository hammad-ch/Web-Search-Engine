In one such operation, it is allowed to half the value of any array element. Examples: Input: Arr[] = [4, 6, 3, 9, 10, 2] Output: 5 Explanation: The initial sum = (4+6+3+9+10+2) = 34 1st step: choose 10 and make it 5, sum = 29 2nd step: choose 9 and make it 4, sum = 24 3rd step: choose 6 and make it 3, sum = 21 4th step: choose 5 and make it 2, sum =18 5th step: choose 4 and make it 2, sum =16 Input: Arr[] = [1, 5, 8, 19] Output: 3 Approach: The idea to solve the problem is by using heap data structure. The target is to reduce the number of operations to make the sum of the array half, thus, At every operation the amount of reduction of the sum value should be as high as possible. To achieve that, try to choose the maximum value available on the array and reducing it to its half value. The best way to find the maximum value at every iteration is to use a priority_queue as a max-heap as max-heap will store the maximum value of the array at the top of the max-heap. To implement this approach follow these steps shown below: Calculate the sum of elements of the array by iterating over the array. Initialize a max-heap using priority_queue to store all elements of the array. Initialize a counter variable to 0, this variable will store the minimum number of operations. As the top of the max-heap will always hold the maximum element present in the array, remove the top-element, make it half (integer division) and enter the new value into the max-heap. Continue this previous step, until the sum of the elements become lesser than or equal to its initial value. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++ // C++ code for the above approach: #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to find minimum operations int minops(vector<int>& nums) { int sum = 0; for (auto x : nums) sum += x; // Initializing max heap priority_queue<int> pq; for (auto x : nums) { pq.push(x); } double temp = sum; int cnt = 0; while (temp > sum / 2) { int x = pq.top(); pq.pop(); temp -= ceil(x * 1.0 / 2); pq.push(x / 2); cnt++; } // Return count return cnt; } // Driver code int main() { vector<int> nums = { 4, 6, 3, 9, 10, 2 }; int count = minops(nums); cout << count << endl; } Output 5 Time complexity: O(N*logN) Auxiliary Space: O(N) My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Previous Find all duplicate levels of given Binary Tree Next Maximise occurrence of an element after K replacements within Array elements Recommended Articles Page : Minimize the maximum difference of any pair by doubling odd elements and reducing even elements by half 20, Dec 20 Minimize operations to reduce N to 2 by repeatedly reducing by 3 or dividing by 5 29, Jul 21 Minimize operations to reduce A or B to 0 by reducing A from B or B from A 15, Feb 22 Sum of Array maximums after K operations by reducing max element to its half 07, Jan 22 Minimize cost for reducing array by replacing two elements with sum at most K times for any index 24, Nov 21 Make all array elements equal by reducing array elements to half minimum number of times 31, Jan 21 Check if given Array can be made a permutation of 1 to N by reducing elements by half 29, Jan 22 Minimize shifting half of each element to either sides to reduce Array 16, Mar 22 Reduce sum of any subset of an array to 1 by multiplying all its elements by any value 25, Feb 21 Maximum sum of values of N items in 0-1 Knapsack by reducing weight of at most K items in half 25, Aug 21 Minimize steps to make Array elements 0 by reducing same A[i] - X from Subarray 10, Mar 22 Find the sum of the first half and second half elements of an array 19, Jul 19 Reorder an array such that sum of left half is not equal to sum of right half 16, Jun 20 Check if array sum of first half is divisible by sum of other half or vice versa 10, Nov 21 Minimize deletions in Array by deleting all occurrences of any number such that array size is reduced to at least half 03, Sep 21 Maximize count of sheets possible by repeatedly reducing its area to half 31, Jan 21 Minimum cost of reducing Array by merging any adjacent elements repetitively 03, Jul 20 Convert given Array to 0 by reducing elements pairwise with any positive value 12, Jan 22 Minimize Cost to reduce the Array to a single element by given operations 14, Aug 20 Reduce array to longest sorted array possible by removing either half of given array in each operation 17, Nov 20 Minimize operations to convert A to B by adding any odd integer or subtracting any even integer 13, Jan 22 Find the XOR of first half and second half elements of an array 27, Apr 20 Reduce every element of the array to it's half retaining the sum zero 18, Nov 19 Minimize operations to reduce N to 0 by replacing N by its divisor at each step 23, Mar 22 Article Contributed By : GeeksforGeeks Vote for difficulty Easy Normal Medium Hard Expert Article Tags : Arrays Greedy Practice Tags : Arrays Greedy Report Issue Writing code in comment?
