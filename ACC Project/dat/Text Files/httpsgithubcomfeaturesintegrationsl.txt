Submit your app for review GitHub API Build on GitHub Create your own tools with greater access to data than ever before using the same API that we use to build GitHub. From release to API in no time Use API endpoints for a feature as soon as it launches. Features on GitHub.com are available in the GraphQL API because they?re built using GraphQL internally first. Precise data in one call Build a GraphQL query that gets you the exact data you need in a single request. No more calling multiple REST endpoints and working through the data yourself. Learn more Pro tip: The GitHub GraphQL API is fresh out of its Early Access program. We?re currently still supporting the previous version of our API, the GitHub REST API. ?
