We have already discussed Three main asymptotic notations. The following 2 more asymptotic notations are used to represent time complexity of algorithms. Little ? asymptotic notation Big-? is used as a tight upper-bound on the growth of an algorithm?s effort (this effort is described by the function f(n)), even though, as written, it can also be a loose upper-bound. ?Little-?? (?()) notation is used to describe an upper-bound that cannot be tight. Definition : Let f(n) and g(n) be functions that map positive integers to positive real numbers. We say that f(n) is ?(g(n)) (or f(n) ? ?(g(n))) if for any real constant c > 0, there exists an integer constant n0 ? 1 such that 0 ? f(n) < c*g(n). Thus, little o() means loose upper-bound of f(n). Little o is a rough estimate of the maximum order of growth whereas Big-? may be the actual order of growth. In mathematical relation, f(n) = o(g(n)) means lim f(n)/g(n) = 0 n?? Examples: Is 7n + 8 ? o(n2)? In order for that to be true, for any c, we have to be able to find an n0 that makes f(n) < c * g(n) asymptotically true. lets took some example, If c = 100,we check the inequality is clearly true. If c = 1/100 , we?ll have to use a little more imagination, but we?ll be able to find an n0. (Try n0 = 1000.) From these examples, the conjecture appears to be correct. then check limits, lim f(n)/g(n) = lim (7n + 8)/(n2) = lim 7/2n = 0 (l?hospital) n?? n?? n?? hence 7n + 8 ? o(n2) Little ? asymptotic notation Definition : Let f(n) and g(n) be functions that map positive integers to positive real numbers. We say that f(n) is ?(g(n)) (or f(n) ? ?(g(n))) if for any real constant c > 0, there exists an integer constant n0 ? 1 such that f(n) > c * g(n) ? 0 for every integer n ? n0. f(n) has a higher growth rate than g(n) so main difference between Big Omega (?) and little omega (?) lies in their definitions.In the case of Big Omega f(n)=?(g(n)) and the bound is 0<=cg(n)<=f(n), but in case of little omega, it is true for 0<=c*g(n)<f(n). The relationship between Big Omega (?) and Little Omega (?) is similar to that of Big-? and Little o except that now we are looking at the lower bounds. Little Omega (?) is a rough estimate of the order of the growth whereas Big Omega (?) may represent exact order of growth. We use ? notation to denote a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight. And, f(n) ? ?(g(n)) if and only if g(n) ? ?((f(n)). In mathematical relation, if f(n) ? ?(g(n)) then, lim f(n)/g(n) = ? n?? Example: Prove that 4n + 6 ? ?(1); the little omega(?) running time can be proven by applying limit formula given below. if lim f(n)/g(n) = ? then functions f(n) is ?(g(n)) n?? here,we have functions f(n)=4n+6 and g(n)=1 lim (4n+6)/(1) = ? n?? and,also for any c we can get n0 for this inequality 0 <= c*g(n) < f(n), 0 <= c*1 < 4n+6 Hence proved.
