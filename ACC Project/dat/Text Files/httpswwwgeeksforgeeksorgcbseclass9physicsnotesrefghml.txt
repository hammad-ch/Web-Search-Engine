Improve Article Save Article Like Article CBSE Class 9 Physics Notes Difficulty Level : Medium Last Updated : 11 Nov, 2021 CBSE Class 9 Physics notes, GeeksforGeeks has created a new approach to school learning. Physics has been among the crucial subjects of the Class 9 Science Syllabus. It helps students in improving their understanding of fascinating concepts. The understanding of how motion, force, work, sound, gravity, energy, and power interact with one another and impact our lives. GeeksforGeeks prepared in-depth subject theory to have a solid foundation of Class 9 Physics. The below-listed articles are designed in such a way that you study everything according to your NCERT textbook, or reference books. Chapter 1: Motion The first chapter in the Physics curriculum of Class 9 is Motion. Motion means movement. Motion is defined as the change in position of an object with respect to its surrounding in a given interval of time. This chapter forms the basic idea of kinematics for students to learn in further classes. Therefore, CBSE Class 9 Physics notes elaborate on distance and displacement, uniform and non-uniform motion, speed, velocity, and accelerated and decelerated motion. It also explains the equation of motion with a graphical representation of motion and uniform circular motion as listed below: Measuring the Rate of Motion Velocity ? Time Graphs Equation of Motion by Graphical Method Uniform Circular Motion Chapter 2: Force and Laws of Motion Force and Laws of Motion is the second chapter in the Class 9 Physics Syllabus. These notes explain the concept of force, its effects, balanced and unbalanced force, laws of motion, and Newton?s laws of motion. It further offers a detailed explanation of mass and inertia, momentum and mass, its unit along with numerical problems for practice. The notes also explain the second law of motion and the third law of motion. Below are the listed articles on Force and Laws of Motion: Force ? Definition, Effects, Types, Sample Problems Balanced and Unbalanced Forces Newton?s First Law of Motion Mass and Inertia Newton?s Second Law of Motion Newton?s Third Law of Motion Conservation of Momentum Chapter 3: Gravitation The third chapter of the Physics in Science syllabus of Class 9 is Gravitation. Gravitation is the universal force of attraction acting between all matter. GeeksforGeeks crucial notes explain Newton?s universal law of gravitation, mass, weight, and the difference between mass and weight. The notes further provide solved numerical problems, which are discussed in the articles listed below: Newton?s Universal Law of Gravitation Kepler?s Law of Planetary Motion Acceleration due to Gravity Factors affecting Acceleration due to Gravity Mass and Weight Free Fall ? Definition, Examples, Formula, and Problems on it Buoyant Force and Causes of Buoyant force Relative Density Chapter 4: Work and Energy The Work and Energy is the fourth chapter in the Physics syllabus and so an important chapter to understand to solve mechanics in further classes. The notes talk about work, a condition when the work should be and when not, its unit, along with positive, negative, and zero work. The notes also elaborate on energy, its types, the law of conservation energy, power, a commercial unit of power and provide solved numericals, discussed in the articles mentioned below: Work ? Definition, Formula, Types of Work, Sample Problems What is Energy? Kinetic Energy Potential Energy Power Commercial Unit of Energy Chapter 5: Sound The last chapter in the Class 9 Physics Syllabus is Sound. Sound is heard every day from various sources like humans, birds, bells, machines, TV, radios, etc. The notes elaborate production and propagation of sound, sound waves as longitudinal waves, their characteristics, wavelength, frequency, time period, amplitude, and velocity. Various other concepts of the speed of sound in multiple mediums, sonic boom, echo, a reflection of sound, range of hearing, application of ultrasound, sonar, and structure of the human ear are also explained in the article listed below: Production and Propagation of Sound Sound Needs a Medium for Propagation What are the Characteristics of Sound Waves? Speed of Sound Reflection of Sound Explain the Working and Application of SONAR Human Ear My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Previous CBSE Physics Class 8 Notes Next CBSE Notes for Class 10 Physics Recommended Articles Page : CBSE Physics Class 8 Notes 11, Nov 21 CBSE Notes for Class 10 Physics 11, Nov 21 CBSE Class 11 Physics Notes 11, Nov 21 CBSE Class 12 Physics Term 1 Answer Key 2021 02, Feb 22 Braille System - Light | Class 8 Physics 01, Mar 21 CBSE Class 9 Maths Notes 19, Apr 21 CBSE Class 12 Maths Notes 11, Nov 21 CBSE Class 11 Maths Notes 03, Jun 21 CBSE Class 8 Maths Notes 19, Apr 21 CBSE Class 10 Maths Notes 20, Apr 21 CBSE Class 10 Chemistry Notes 09, Jan 22 CBSE Class 9 Chemistry Notes 09, Jan 22 CBSE Class 8 Chemistry Notes 09, Jan 22 How is Physics related to Other Sciences? 25, Jun 21 What is Physics?
