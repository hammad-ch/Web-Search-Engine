The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. There are three types of CSS which are given below: Inline Internal or Embedded External Basic Format: It is the basic structure of HTML webpage and we use CSS style inside webpage. In a web page, we use internal CSS (i.e. adding CSS code inside <head> tag of HTML code). 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 
<head>
    <!-- Head section of web page -->
    <title></title>
 
    <!-- Stylesheet of web page --> 
    <style></style>
</head>
 
<body>
    <!-- Body section of web page -->
</body>
 
</html>
 Example: Let?s see a small example of HTML webpage with CSS styles. Here, we use styles to set the alignment and text color of a webpage. 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>
        Simple webpage
    </title>

    <!-- Stylesheet of web page -->
    <style>
        body {
            text-align: center;
        }

        h1 {
            color: green;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
