Testimonials I was attracted to transferring to the University because of the increased opportunities, both academically and socially. All staff and faculty were willing to help and be supportive. When registering for courses I went to meetings designed to teach transfer nursing students how to function as a University student. When I had questions, I emailed or called a Student Success Co-ordinator, and they were always a big help. The memories I have made here will stay with me forever. Sarah Moore Nursing transfer student from St. Clair College The bridge program between the University of Windsor and St. Clair College attracted me to transferring, as well as the diversity of the curriculum, proximity to home, developing relationships with like-minded peers and the opportunities to volunteer and grow as a young adult. I had so much support from each school which made the entire transfer process easy and stress free. The transfer advisors, administrators, and professors were all dedicated to help me succeed.

The transfer credit evaluation process can take up to 3-4 weeks to complete and post to the student records from the time the course outlines have been received. I took some post-secondary courses 10 years ago. Will they still transfer? Yes, we will recognize courses completed in the past but considered on an individual basis and some form of course documentation must be provided. Please review the Course Outline Guidelines. Is there a minimum grade for transfer credit? Transfer credit is granted at a minimum grade of 60% for University level / undergraduate degree program courses and 70% for College level / diploma program courses. Who evaluates my Transfer Credit application? The Admissions and Records Officer that is assigned to your application process is point person responsible for evaluating your transfer credits. Additional staff in the Office of the Registrar and in each faculty will be involved in the process of new course evaluations as required, but the primary point of contact is the Admissions and Records Officer for any inquiries. How do I request a letter of permission? LOPs are requested through your Admissions Officer by completing the Letter of Permission Application. The form provides the necessary information required and delivery requirements to have the form processed. Please allow for 2 weeks to process. The LOP must be approved prior to course registration at the school you wish to take the course(s) to ensure transfer credit will be granted upon completion of the course. How do I view my Transfer Credits on my UWinSite account? Transfer credits processed at the time of admission will be present on the Letter of Admission. Transfer credit that is processed after the time of admission can be viewed once the students UWinsite Account is activated for registration, typically 2-3 weeks prior to the start of registration for a term. To view your Transfer Credits, log into your UWinSite account and click on the tab titled, ?Transfer Credits?. After receiving Transfer Credit I disagree with the transfer credit decision I received. Can I request a reassessment? How do I appeal a Transfer Credit decision? A Transfer Credit Appeal form must be completed and submitted to the Registrars Office along with additional new supporting course documentation that supports the appeal above and beyond what was originally provided and the original course outline. I received an Unspecified Transfer Credit (e.g., PSYC-1xxx) but wanted a specific transfer credit required for my program (e.g., PSYC-1150). Why was the course not granted this specific credit? Our faculty Subject Matter Evaluators (SME?s) determine credit based on an extensive review of the documentation provided, focussing on course content, learning outcomes, credit weight, number of contact hours and often topics and assignments. If these do not well align to a specific UWindsor course, then an unspecified elective course credit will be issued. There may be an opportunity to be eligible for a course substitution. Please see an Academic Advisor from your respective program to review your transfer credits and Academic Advising Report to determine what your options. What can I do with an Unspecified Elective Course Transfer Credit? An unspecified elective course credit (anything that ends in 1XXX, 2XXX, 3XXX, or 4XXX) will be applied towards other/elective requirements for your degree on your Academic Advising Report. Depending on your degree requirements, not all transfer credit granted will align with your degree requirements. It is strongly advised that the student meet with an Academic Advisor. If I received a Transfer Credit but I would prefer to take the course, can I do that? No, you cannot decline transfer credit; however, you can repeat a course that you earned transfer credit for at UWindsor if you so wish and have the grade you earned in the course count towards your academic records in place of the transfer credit. Can I transfer credits from one degree to another? If you wish to transfer to another UWindsor degree program, your credits earned through Transfer Credit or through courses taken here will be aligned to your new Academic Advising Report for the new degree program. In some unique cases, some credits that are specific to a faculty may be reassessed. Not all previously awarded transfer credits may apply to the new degree requirements. It is strongly advised that the student meet with an Academic Advisor. What does a No Rule status mean? The course from the previously attended institution has not been previously evaluated by UWindsor for course equivalency and requires review by the appropriate faculty Subject Matter Evaluators (SME?s) to determine transfer credit eligibility and course equivalency. Students are still eligible to apply for admission and transfer credit assessment past these deadlines up until the start of the term; however, a late application may not receive their transfer credit information prior to registration. This may lead to challenge in determining your course selection and academic plan. General FAQs What is the difference between Degree Completion (DC) and Transfer Credit (TC) Pathways? Degree Completion recognizes the completion of a college diploma or university degree by granting admission into an upper year of a specific Windsor program with a defined block of credits, leaving a set number of course requirements to achieved to complete your degree. Transfer Credits are university or college courses completed at another institution and applied towards the requirements of a degree at a different post secondary institution.

Alignment of the credits to your degree can be viewed on your UWinsite Student account in your Academic Advising Report. It is strongly advised that the student meet with an Academic Advisor. What can I use my Transfer Credits Towards? Transfer credits will be applied against courses in your degree requirements. If transfer credit was granted for specific UWindsor courses and those are part of your degree requirements, then these will be recognized your in Academic Advising Report on your UWinsite Student account automatically. Transfer credit for specific UWindsor courses or unspecified elective courses (anything that ends in 1XXX, 2XXX, 3XXX, or 4XXX) will be applied to appropriate elective requirements in your Academic Advising Report. It is important to understand that sometimes not all transfer credit granted will align with your degree requirements. It is strongly advised that the student meet with an Academic Advisor.
