Example: Input: N = 8 Output: 2 Explanation: {1} is divisor set of 1 {1, 2} is divisor set of 2 {1, 3} is divisor set of 3 {1, 2, 4} is divisor set of 4 {1, 5} is divisor set of 5 {1, 2, 3, 6} is divisor set of 6 {1, 7} is divisor set of 7 {1, 2, 4, 8} is divisor set of 8 So, 6 and 8 are only natural numbers less than or equal to N and count of divisors 4. Input: N = 2 Output: 0 Approach: The idea to solve the problem is based on the following observation: Any number M can be written in form M = p1e1 * p2e2 * . . . where (p1, p2 . . .) are primes and (e1, e2 . . .) are respective exponents. The total number of factors of M is therefore (e + 1)*(e + 1)* . . . From above points, for the count of divisors of a natural number to be 4, there are two cases:- Case-1: N = p1 * p2 (where p1 and p2 are two distinct prime numbers) Case-2: N = p3 (where p is a prime number) So there must be two primes whose multiplication is less than N or one prime whose cube is less than N. Follow the steps mentioned below to solve the problem: Find all the prime numbers less than or equal to N using the sieve of Eratosthenes. For Case-1 iterate through all prime numbers and use binary search to find a number of primes whose product is at most N. For Case-2, do a binary search to find the number of primes whose cube is less than or equal to N. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++ // C++ program for the above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to find primes <= N vector<int> SieveOfEratosthenes(int n) { // Create a boolean array // "prime[0..n]" and initialize // all entries it as true. // A value in prime[i] will // finally be false if i is // Not a prime, else true. bool prime[n + 1]; memset(prime, true, sizeof(prime)); for (long long int p = 2; p * p <= n; p++) { // If prime[p] is not changed, // then it is a prime if (prime[p] == true) { // Update all multiples // of p greater than or // equal to the square of it for (long long int i = p * p; i <= n; i += p) prime[i] = false; } } // Vector for storing prime number // less than or equal to N vector<int> primes; // Store all prime numbers for (int p = 2; p <= n; p++) if (prime[p]) primes.push_back(p); return primes; } // Find floor of cube root of N int primeCubic(vector<int>& primes, int N) { // Val stores cube root of N long long int l = 0, r = N, mid, val; // Binary search loop for finding // floor of cube root of N while (l <= r) { mid = (l + r) / 2; if ((mid * mid * mid) <= N) { val = mid; l = mid + 1; } else { r = mid - 1; } } // Iterator for finding index with // value just greater than Val in primes auto it = upper_bound(primes.begin(), primes.end(), val); it--; return (it - primes.begin() + 1); } // Function to find primes with product <= N int primeProduct(vector<int>& primes, int N) { // Stores the answer int answer = 0; // Iterator storing pointer to // current prime auto cur = primes.begin(); // Loop for traversing all primes // Find number of indices less than // current indices for which product // is less than or equal to N for (auto i : primes) { long long int add = upper_bound(primes.begin(), cur, (N / i)) - primes.begin(); answer += add; cur++; } return answer; } // Function to find the total count int print(int N) { vector<int> primes = SieveOfEratosthenes(N); int answer = 0; answer += primeCubic(primes, N); answer += primeProduct(primes, N); return answer; } // Driver code int main() { int N = 8; // Print function Call cout << print(N); return 0; } Output 2 Time Complexity: O(N * log(logN) + N + logN) ?
