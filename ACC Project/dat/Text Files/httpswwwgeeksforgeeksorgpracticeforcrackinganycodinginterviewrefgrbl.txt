The idea of this post is to target two types of people. Competitive Programming Preparation (For Ist and IInd Year Students) : It is recommended to finish all questions from all categories except possibly Linked List, Tree and BST. However at least 10 questions from these categories should also be covered. If you have never done competitive programming before, it is strongly recommended to see How to Begin with Competitive Programming first. If you wish to get yourself prepared with a language first, you may first begin C++ Track or Java Track Interview preparation It is recommended to cover all topics. In every topic, you can start from questions according to your comfort level. The practice system tells you exactly the test case where your code failed. In case you need more clarity about a question, you may use the expected output button to see output for your given input. You can also view successful submissions of others in case you are stuck. To see solutions of others, please click the ?All Submissions? button at the bottom of the problem statement.
