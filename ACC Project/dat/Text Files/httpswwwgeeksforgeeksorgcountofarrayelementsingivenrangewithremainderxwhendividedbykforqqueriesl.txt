For each query, the task is to find the count of all elements in index range [l, r] which have remainder x when divided by K. Examples: Input: arr[] = {15, 28, 72, 43, 20, 0, 97}, K = 5, queries[] = {{3, 0, 3}, {0, 0, 6}, {6, 2, 4}} Output: 2, 3, 0 Explanation: For the first query, there are 2 elements in the range [0, 3] whose remainder is 3 (28, 43). Similarly 3 elements in range [0, 6] whose remainder is 0 (15, 20, 0). In the third query, elements whose remainder are 6 should be found. But for the given K = 5 possible remainders are only [0, 4]. So for any x >= K, answer will be 0. Input: arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 7, 5}, K = 3, queries[] = {{2, 1, 4}} Output: 1 Method 1: A simple approach is, for each query, iterate through l to r and count all elements whose remainder is x. Time Complexity: O(N * Q) Auxiliary Space: O(1) Method 2: This problem can also be solved with help of precalculation based on the following idea: Precalculate what will be the remainder, when arr[i] is divided by K and store them in a matrix (say mat[]) where mat[i][j] represents the remainder of arr[j] is i when divided by K. Now prefix sum of ith row of the matrix gives the count of elements which will have remainder i when divided by K. Therefore, after prefix sum mat[i][j] will represent total count of elements till jth index having remainder i when divided by K. So for a query {x, l, r} the answer will be (mat[x][r] ? mat[x][l] [+1 if arr[l]%K is x]) Follow the illustration below for a better understanding of the construction of the matrix. Illustration: Consider arr[] = {15, 28, 72, 43, 20, 0, 97}, K = 5 Make a 2D matrix named precompute, of size (K*N), and initialize it with 0. For the ith element, mark precompute[arr[i]%K][i] = 1, do this for all i which states that the ith element has remainder arr[i]%K. For the given example our precompute matrix will look like the following where row: remainder, column: index num. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 3 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Then for each row calculate prefix sum. Now matrix will look like this: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 1 1 1 2 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 3 0 1 1 2 2 2 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Here precompute[0][6] denotes that till 6th index there are a total of 3 elements which will have reaminder 3 when divided by 5. Follow the steps mentioned below to implement the idea: Create the 2D array (say precompute). Construct the array as mentioned above. Traverse the queries: For each query calculate the number of elements as per the formula shown above and store that in the answer array. Return the array having the answers. Note: This method is more efficient only when the number of queries is greater than K. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++ // C++ program for the above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; const int MXN = 2e5; int precompute[100][MXN]; // To precompute count prefix sum of all // possible remainders void precomputation(int arr[], int n, int k) { // Mark cell whose remainder is arr[i]%k for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) precompute[arr[i] % k][i] = 1; // Take prefix sum for all rows for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) { for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) { precompute[i][j] += precompute[i][j - 1]; } } } // Function to find the // count of numbers for the queries vector<int> findCount(int arr[], int K, int N, vector<vector<int> >& queries) { vector<int> res; // Intialise matrix with 0 memset(precompute, 0, sizeof precompute); // To calculate count of reaminders precomputation(arr, N, K); for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) { int x = queries[i][0]; int l = queries[i][1]; int r = queries[i][2]; if (x >= K) { res.push_back(0); continue; } int count = precompute[x][r] - precompute[x][l] + (arr[l] % K == x); res.push_back(count); } return res; } // Driver code int main() { int arr[] = { 15, 28, 72, 43, 20, 0, 97 }; int K = 5; int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); vector<vector<int> > queries{ { 3, 0, 3 }, { 0, 0, 6 }, { 6, 2, 4 } }; vector<int> ans = findCount(arr, K, N, queries); for (int x : ans) cout << x << " "; return 0; } Output 2 3 0 Time Complexity: O(Q + K*N) Auxiliary Space: O(K*N) My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Previous IISc Bangalore M.E.
