Revised Grading Regulations for Winter 2021 through Winter 2022 Courses In response to the difficulties that many students are facing because of COVID-19, the University announced Revised Grading Regulations to provide students with new flexibility in deciding how their academic performance is recorded for the Winter 2021 through Winter 2022 semesters. Details and deadlines are outlined in the article on selecting a revised grading option. Read SAFA's COVID-19 Updates to understand the impact on student awards, of choosing a P/NP grade or a late VW. Alternate Grading Policy Details: The alternate grading policy enacted for Winter 2021 has been extended to the end of Winter 2022. With this policy, once final grades have been posted, eligible students have three options These are: To retain the final course grade assigned by the professor (no action required on the part of the student); To request a Pass/ Non-Pass grade for one course based on the minimum required passing grade in their program or course; or, To voluntarily withdrawal from a course(s) without academic penalty. Currently, eligible students include: Undergraduate students ? both the Pass/Non-Pass and Voluntary Withdrawal options Graduate students ? both the Pass/Non-Pass and Voluntary Withdrawal options Law students ? Pass/Non-Pass option only If students opt to voluntarily withdraw, they will be able to do so through the normal class drop method through UWinsite Student up until the end of the last day of class in each session within a semester. After that point, students can select to voluntarily withdraw, as well as select one course to change to a Pass/Non-Pass through the ?Alternate Grade/Grade Appeal? tile on the student self service home page. The deadline for this is dependent on when grades are deemed final for each semester. This date varies from semester to semester, based on when the bulk of grades have been submitted. The current tentative dates for each semester are: Semester Session Session End Date Alternate Grade Policy Close Date Inter/Summer 2021 Intersession (6 wk) June 22, 2021 July 16, 2021 Inter/Summer 2021 Summer Session (6 wk) August 10, 2021 September 10, 2021 Inter/Summer 2021 Full Summer Session (12 wk) August 11, 2021 September 10, 2021 Fall 2021 12 week Session December 8, 2021 January 21, 2022 Winter 2022 12 week Session April 6, 2022 May 13, 2022 Official Transcript Submissions If you are required to provide an official transcript to the University of Windsor for admissions or confirmation purposes, the Office of the Registrar will accept official transcripts emailed directly from other secondary and post-secondary institutions.
