Sign in Sign up {{ message }} About Diversity Global Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at GitHub As home to the largest developer community in the world, we believe deeply in the potential and the power of a diverse open source community. We feel it is our responsibility to promote diversity and inclusion, and integrate these values into every aspect of what we do. How do we do this? Our global diversity, inclusion, and belonging strategy is aligned across four pillars: Platform , People , Philanthropy , and Policy . Take a deeper dive into each below. Platform Our mission is to accelerate human progress through developer collaboration. Whether they?re newcomers or experienced professionals, we want developers of all abilities and skill levels to have a place where they can build, collaborate, and continue to hone their craft. We prioritize global accessibility by investing in developer outreach globally, fostering a strong community on our platform, and integrating ADA best practices . Learn more about our platform Software development should be accessible, inclusive, and sustainable, so that developers around the world can learn, contribute, grow, and feel like they belong. Provide an on-ramp for the next generation of developers The Major League Hacking (MLH) MLH Fellowship, Powered by GitHub is a remote program now available in over 32 regions that matches students with open source projects and mentors. GitHub Education has served 2.5 million students globally and provides students, teachers, and schools with access to powerful tools that support the growth and learning of the next generation of developers. Use inclusive language We coordinated with industry partners and the Git community more broadly to drive the work to change the default branch name for new GitHub repositories from master to main . We are now working with a number of organizations to make this an industry-wide change. GitHub Mobile is now available in English, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish . Now more developers can organize tasks, respond to issues, and review and merge pull requests on the go ? in more languages than ever. Contribute where it counts GitHub Sponsors allows the developer community and corporations to financially support the people and organizations who design, build, and maintain the open source projects they depend on, directly on GitHub. In 2020, we joined forces with Microsoft and LinkedIn in a global skills initiative aimed at bringing more digital skills to 25 million people worldwide. Amplify under?represented voices ReadME Project spotlights a diverse range of voices in the global open source community: the maintainers, developers, and teams whose powerful contributions move the world forward every day. GitHub Stars is a platform for our most influential developers to showcase their work, reach more people, and shape the future of GitHub. People We want our teams at GitHub to reflect the global developer community. In order to be truly innovative and build the best home for the world?s developers, our team must reflect the community we serve, so we invest in building teams with diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and life experiences. Learn more about people and culture Our goal at GitHub is to create a culture fueled by people who are passionate about building a global community of developers and doing the best work of their lives along the way. Apply data to our hiring process We set and track ambitious hiring, retention, and promotional goals for underrepresented communities. Hold ourselves accountable We share our annual Diversity Report, which brings transparency to diversity efforts, like representation in tech roles and in leadership. Promote continuous learning We invest in unconscious bias, privilege, and allyship training for all employees. This empowers everyone to develop awareness, exercise curiosity, and demonstrate courage. Collaborate and co-create We closely collaborate with our Communities of Belonging (CoB) and with our Inclusion Advisory Council (IAC) to guide and inform our priorities. Provide support for Hubbers We offer competitive benefits, including access to mental health services, a wellness stipend, $2,000 USD a year for learning and development, and back-up child care and adult/elder care. Philan?thropy We are dedicated to supporting nonprofits and social sector organizations through employee and company donations, service projects, and special programs. To do this, our Social Impact Team connects organizations with Hubbers, our products, and the broader open source community. Learn more about GitHub Social Impact Tech for Social Good We created Tech for Social Good to strengthen social sector organizations working on issues that impact developers and their communities, like the COVID-19 public health response. We do this by supporting research, guides and tools, community building, and sponsorship. Our objective is to leverage GitHub's platform and products to strengthen the social sector in achieving the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hubber Giving Hubbers are incredibly generous and give their time, talent, and expertise to nonprofits. In order to further support those efforts, we match up to $15,000 USD in donations annually. As part of every team retreat or offsite, we integrate volunteer opportunities and provide 40 hours of volunteer credits per year to all Hubbers. Policy We use our platform to advance issues that protect and promote inclusive opportunities through law, regulation, and social action. Policy can play a big role in shaping who has the opportunity to be a developer and what developers can build. That?s why our Policy Team is focused on local and global initiatives, like securing access for developers in Iran, advocating for DACA, and joining amicus briefs alongside Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and other tech organizations in support of international students remaining in the U.S. Learn more about our policy work Protecting privacy and security We also contribute to projects that protect the privacy and security of people across the globe, especially at-risk populations?and work to foster and protect developers' ability to collaborate and drive change. Promote civic engagement Finally, we promote civic engagement by developers globally, including making sure that Hubbers have paid time off to vote and serve as election workers.
