Examples: Input: arr[] = {-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} Output: 4 Explanation: Total absolute value subtracted = 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 18. Total absolute value added = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 12 Sum achieved = -6. Make {5, 0} the exceptional elements Add 5 to sum and subtract 0 from sum. So total value subtracted = 13 and total value added = 17 New Sum = 17 ? 3 = 4. This is the maximum possible sum. Input: arr[] = {1, -2, 3} Output: 0 Approach: The problem can be solved based on the following idea: To maximize the sum, the maximum absolute value which is subtracted (say max) and the minimum absolute value which is added (say min) should be the exceptional elements. So the sum will increase by 2*(max ? min). Now, this should be performed only when min is less than max. Otherwise, the above term will become negative and will reduce the total sum. Follow the below steps to solve the problem: Initialize the variables Max, Min, Sum to store maximum absolute odd, minimum absolute even and total sum respectively. Traverse the array from 0 to N ? 1. If element is odd then subtract its absolute from the Sum and update Max. If element is even then add its absolute value to the Sum and update Min. If Min is greater than Max then no need to update sum. Else, update the Sum, Sum = Sum + 2*(Max ? Min). Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++ // C++ code for above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to return maximum sum // after swapping int maxSum(int* arr, int N) { // Initialize the variables int Max = INT_MIN; int Min = INT_MAX; int X, Sum = 0; // Traverse the array for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { X = arr[i]; // If element is odd then subtract // it from the Sum and update maximum if (X & 1) { Max = max(Max, abs(X)); Sum -= abs(X); } // Else add it to the Sum and // update minimum else { Min = min(Min, abs(X)); Sum += abs(X); } } // If minimum even element is greater // than maximum odd element then no // need to swap if (Min >= Max) return Sum; // Else print the sum after swapping return (Sum + 2 * (Max - Min)); } // Driver Code int main() { int arr[] = { -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); // Function call cout << maxSum(arr, N); return 0; } Output 4 Time Complexity: O(N) Auxiliary Space: O(1) My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Previous Count of numbers up to N having only 4 factors or divisors Next Find edge to be deleted from Tree to maximise product of XOR of components Recommended Articles Page : Minimize adding odd and subtracting even numbers to make all array elements equal to K 28, Oct 20 Absolute difference between sum of even elements at even indices & odd elements at odd indices in given Array 04, Dec 21 Minimize operations to convert A to B by adding any odd integer or subtracting any even integer 13, Jan 22 Minimize absolute value of N in K moves by adding or subtracting D 19, Jan 22 Maximize the difference of sum of elements at even indices and odd indices by shifting an odd sized subarray to end of given Array. 29, Dec 21 Find the nearest odd and even perfect squares of odd and even array elements respectively 05, Mar 21 Make all elements of an Array equal by adding or subtracting at most K 04, Apr 20 Maximize Sum possible by subtracting same value from all elements of a Subarray of the given Array 15, Aug 20 Make max elements in B[] equal to that of A[] by adding/subtracting integers in range [0, K] 09, Aug 20 Make an array strictly increasing by repeatedly subtracting and adding arr[i - 1] - (i - 1) to adjacent indices 27, May 21 Minimum operations to make Array equal by repeatedly adding K from an element and subtracting K from other 01, Jul 21 Minimize difference with 0 after adding or subtracting any element of the given Array 16, Jan 22 Count numbers up to C that can be reduced to 0 by adding or subtracting A or B 14, Apr 21 Check whether N can be a Perfect Cube after adding or subtracting K 20, Mar 20 Check if given intervals can be made non-overlapping by adding/subtracting some X 12, Jun 20 Count of distinct values till C formed by adding or subtracting A, B, or 0 any number of times 16, Jun 21 Modify Binary Tree by replacing all nodes at even and odd levels by their nearest even or odd perfect squares respectively 22, Feb 21 Count numbers from given range having odd digits at odd places and even digits at even places 02, Dec 20 Even numbers at even index and odd numbers at odd index 28, Oct 17 Check if a number has an odd count of odd divisors and even count of even divisors 20, Aug 20 Count of integers in a range which have even number of odd digits and odd number of even digits 21, Aug 19 Make all the elements of array odd by incrementing odd-indexed elements of odd-length subarrays 16, Dec 20 Minimum sum of the elements of an array after subtracting smaller elements from larger 30, Nov 18 Count possible removals to make absolute difference between the sum of odd and even indexed elements equal to K 10, Dec 20 Article Contributed By : akashjha2671 @akashjha2671 Vote for difficulty Easy Normal Medium Hard Expert Article Tags : Geeks-Premier-League-2022 Arrays Geeks Premier League Mathematical Practice Tags : Arrays Mathematical Report Issue Writing code in comment?
