 * Removed dead code in `lib/utils/usage.js`.
 * Removed dead code in `lib/base-command.js`.
 * Removed "load-all" test, we currently have 100% coverage and new PRs
   without tests will be rejected if they don't add coverage for new
   files.
 * Removed `check-coverage` script as a separate command.
 * Removed separate coverage test in ci.yml.
 * Removed `coverage` flag from tap config, the default is already to
   enforce 100% coverage.

Removed a tiny bit of dead code resulting from this

* fix: clean up usage output

Removed usage lib, rolled logic into base-command.js
Cleaned up usage output to be less redundant 716a07f Git stats 10,879 commits Files Permalink Failed to load latest commit information.

You can read more about configuring third-party registries here FAQ on Branding Is it "npm" or "NPM" or "Npm"? npm should never be capitalized unless it is being displayed in a location that is customarily all-capitals (ex. titles on man pages). Is "npm" an acronym for "Node Package Manager"? Contrary to popular belief, npm is not in fact an acronym for "Node Package Manager"; It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for "npm is not an acronym" (if the project was named "ninaa", then it would be an acronym). The precursor to npm was actually a bash utility named "pm", which was the shortform name of "pkgmakeinst" - a bash function that installed various things on various platforms. If npm were to ever have been considered an acronym, it would be as "node pm" or, potentially "new pm".
